# This is a program that asks the user for the weight of their package and

# cost to ship their package

# The cheapest way to ship 4.8 pound package is using ground shipping and it will cost $34.40.
# The cheapest way to ship a 41.5 pound package is using premium ground shipping and it will cost $125.00.
