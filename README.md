The Cipher Utility project aims to provide a versatile tool for encrypting and decrypting data using various cipher techniques. By employing methods like the Caesar cipher, the project facilitates secure data transformation to ensure confidentiality.

## Project Overview

The Cipher Utility project enables users to:

- Encrypt data by shifting characters forward in the ASCII table.
- Decrypt encrypted data by shifting characters backward in the ASCII table.

## How It Works

The program supports the Caesar cipher method as an example. It encrypts text by shifting each character a specific number of positions forward in the ASCII table. For instance, "I am here" encrypted with a shift of 3 positions would become "L#dp#khuh." Decryption involves the reverse process.

## Running the Program

To run the program:

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/naa7/cipher_utility.git`
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory:
   - For executable files: `$ cd cipher_utility/exec_files/`
   - For Python files: `$ cd cipher_utility/python_files/`
3. Run the program:
   - For executable files: `$ ./cipher_utility.exe`
   - For Python files: `$ python cipher_utility.py`

### Optional: Easy Timer Installation

1. Run installer_uninstaller.exe:
   - For installer/uninstaller: `$ ./installer_uninstaller.exe`

After installation, you can conveniently use the timer by typing `cipher_utility` in the terminal or accessing it from the applications menu.

## Enhancing Data Security and Privacy

Cipher Utility serves as a valuable tool for individuals seeking to encrypt and decrypt their data securely. By leveraging different cipher techniques, the project contributes to enhancing data security and privacy.
